# CosmiQ - Makefile Updates Summary

## Changes Made

The Makefile has been updated to use the **Next.js UI** instead of Streamlit as the default frontend.

### ‚úÖ What Changed

#### 1. `make run` command
**Before**: Started Streamlit on port 8502
```bash
uv run --env-file .env streamlit run app_home.py
```

**After**: Starts Next.js on port 3000
```bash
cd app && npm run dev
```

#### 2. `make start-all` command
**Before**: Started all services with Streamlit UI
- Port 8502 for Streamlit

**After**: Starts all services with Next.js UI
- Port 3000 for Next.js
- Updated console messages to show CosmiQ branding
- Shows new port: http://localhost:3000

#### 3. `make stop-all` command
**Before**: Killed Streamlit process
```bash
pkill -f "streamlit run app_home.py"
```

**After**: Kills Next.js process
```bash
pkill -f "next dev"
```

#### 4. `make status` command
**Before**: Checked Streamlit status

**After**: Checks Next.js status with "Next.js UI" label

#### 5. New Frontend Commands Added
```bash
make ui          # Start Next.js dev server (same as make ui-dev)
make ui-install  # Install npm dependencies
make ui-build    # Build production bundle
make ui-dev      # Start development server
```

### üìù Important Notes

1. **Streamlit is NOT removed**: The old Streamlit app (`app_home.py`, `pages/`) remains in the codebase and can still be run manually if needed:
   ```bash
   uv run --env-file .env streamlit run app_home.py
   ```

2. **API remains unchanged**: The FastAPI backend is still on port 5055 and works with both UIs.

3. **No breaking changes**: The Makefile still supports all existing workflows, just with the Next.js UI as default.

4. **Supervisor configs unchanged**: Docker deployments using `supervisord.conf` still reference Streamlit. These would need separate updates for production deployment.

### üß™ Testing Instructions

See `app/TESTING.md` for comprehensive testing guide.

**Quick test:**
```bash
# Test UI only
make run

# Test full stack
make start-all

# Check status
make status

# Stop everything
make stop-all
```

### üöÄ Ready for Phase 2

With Phase 1 complete and Makefile updated, you can now:
1. Test Phase 1 components at http://localhost:3000
2. Verify all UI components work correctly
3. Approve moving to Phase 2 (Dashboard implementation)

---

**All Makefile changes are backward compatible and the Streamlit UI remains available for fallback.**
