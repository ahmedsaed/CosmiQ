## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### React Portals for Modals
**Why**: Modals were rendering within sidebar constraints, causing poor UX

**Solution**: 
```typescript
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

// Check if mounted (prevent SSR issues)
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);

if (!mounted) return null;

// Render modal at document.body
const modalContent = (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 ...">
    {/* Modal content */}
  </div>
);

return createPortal(modalContent, document.body);
```

**Benefits**:
- Modals center properly on screen
- Full viewport backdrop
- No parent container constraints
- Better z-index control

### Reference Parsing Strategy
**Challenge**: AI responses include references like `[source:abc123]` that need to be interactive

**Solution**:
1. Regex parse: `/\[([^\]]+)\]/g` captures all `[...]` patterns
2. Split by comma for multiple refs: `[source:id1, note:id2]`
3. Validate format: `/^(source_insight|source|note):[a-z0-9]+$/`
4. Fetch names in parallel with `Promise.all()`
5. Render as clickable buttons with truncation
6. Open modals on click with full content

**Benefits**:
- Flexible parsing (handles single and multiple refs)
- Smart fallbacks (never shows "Unknown")
- Async loading doesn't block UI
- Type-safe with full error handling

### Streaming Response Handling
**Challenge**: Real-time display of AI responses without blocking

**Solution**:
- Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) via EventSource API
- Parse `data: {...}` lines from stream
- Append chunks to state with `setAnswer(prev => prev + chunk)`
- Auto-scroll container to bottom
- Handle connection errors and completion

**Benefits**:
- Better UX (users see response as it generates)
- No timeout issues with long responses
- Can cancel mid-generation
- Progress feedback built-in

5. **Component Composition**: Reusable modals and cards saved development time

### What Needed Adjustment
1. **Streaming Implementation**: Required backend fix for proper SSE handling
2. **Reference Parsing**: Needed multiple iterations to handle all edge cases
3. **Modal Positioning**: React portals were necessary for proper centering
4. **Fallback Strategies**: Smart defaults improved UX significantly

### Best Practices Established
1. Always use React portals for modals
2. Implement loading states for all async operations
3. Provide meaningful fallbacks (never show "Unknown")
4. Use truncation + tooltips for long text
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
6. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
